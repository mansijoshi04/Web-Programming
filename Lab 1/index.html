    <h1>Basic Concept of Web Technology</h1>

    <h2>Define HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used to create web pages. HTML defines the structure and content of a webpage using various elements and tags.</p>

    <h2>Define Client-server model of communications</h2>
    <p>The client-server model is a computing architecture where clients request resources or services from servers. Servers are responsible for processing these requests and sending back the requested data.</p>

    <h2>Write down the name of different types of servers</h2>
    <p>Different types of servers are email servers, file servers, and database servers.</p>

    <h2>Define a Web Server</h2>
    <p>A web server is a software or hardware component that serves web content to clients over the HTTP or HTTPS protocol. It processes client requests and delivers webpages, images, and other resources.</p>

    <h2>Define Data Centers</h2>
    <p>Data centers are centralized facilities used to house and manage computer systems, servers and networking equipment. They are designed to store, process, and manage data and applications reliably and efficiently.</p>

    <h2>Why do we need a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)?</h2>
    <p>A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is used to uniquely identify and locate resources on the web. It enables users to access webpages and resources by specifying the resource's address.</p>

    <h2>Give an example of Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and specify all components of a URL</h2>
    <p>An example of a URL is: <br>
    <code>https://www.example.com:8080/path/to/resource?param1=value1&amp;param2=value2</code></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Scheme: https</li>
        <li>Host: www.example.com</li>
        <li>Port: 8080</li>
        <li>Path: /path/to/resource</li>
        <li>Query: param1=value1&amp;param2=value2</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is the difference between a static and a dynamic web site?</h2>
    <p>A static website contains fixed content that does not change unless manually updated. A dynamic website, generates content on-the-fly in response to user interactions or data from a database, making it more interactive and adaptable.</p>

    <h2>Why do we need Domain Name System (DNS)?</h2>
    <p>The Domain Name System (DNS) is used to translate human-readable domain name into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the internet. It makes it easier for users to access websites without needing to remember numerical IP addresses.</p>

    <h2>Describe in detail the process of DNS address resolution?</h2>
    <p>The DNS resolution process involves several steps, including querying DNS servers, caching, and ultimately resolving a domain name to an IP address. This process ensures efficient and accurate mapping between domain names and IP addresses.</p>

    <h2>Give some examples of generic top-Level domains (gTLD)</h2>
    <p>Examples of gTLDs include .com, .org, .net, .info, .gov, and .edu .</p>

    <h2>Give some examples of country code top-Level domains (ccTLD)</h2>
    <p>Examples of ccTLDs include .uk (United Kingdom), .ca (Canada), .jp (Japan), .au (Australia), and .de (Germany).</p>

    <h2>How can you pass a userâ€™s information from the client to the web server?</h2>
    <p>User information can be passed from the client to the web server using methods like HTML forms, cookies and AJAX requests.</p>

    <h2>What is the function (purpose) of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)?</h2>
    <p>HTTP is the protocol used for transferring data over the World Wide Web. Its primary purpose is to enable communication between web clients and web servers, facilitating the retrieval and display of web content.</p>

    <h2>Describe how a single web page is displayed on a web browser.</h2>
    <p>When a user enters a URL in a web browser, the browser sends an HTTP request to the web server. The server processes the request, retrieves the requested webpage's HTML and associated resources, and sends them back to the browser. The browser then renders the HTML, displaying the webpage's content.</p>

    <h2>Give some examples of HTTP request methods.</h2>
    <p>Common HTTP request methods include GET, POST, PUT, DELETE and HEAD.</p>
